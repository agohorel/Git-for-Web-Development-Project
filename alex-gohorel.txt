Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

A block element occupies all available width (regardless of the size of its contents), pushing subsequent items to a new line.
Inline elements only take up as much space as they need to and do not push subsequent items to a new line.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

Absolutely positioned items are placed explicity, relative to their nearest ancestor with relative or absolute position. Elements with
absolute position are removed from the "flow" of elements on the page - i.e. other elements will act as if this element isn't there.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

Set it's display property to inline-block.

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

The box model is the basic layout model in CSS. It describes the size and spacing of elements. Elements have an intrinsic size ("content") inner spacing ("padding"), 
an optional border ("border"), and outer spacing ("margin").

The "fix" for the box model is to set the box-sizing property to "border-box" so it accounts for border and padding which makes it a lot easier to size things as intended.
